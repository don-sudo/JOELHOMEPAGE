                <p>During my time in high school I had it really good moments, but my best moments that I’ve experienced are 
                in a particular class during my senior year, in Baguio City National Science High School. The teahcer's and student's were approacable,
                the school buildings were at it's finest, and BCNSHS has the widest school ground where-in you can play extra curricular activities</p>

                <p>Growing up, I’ve heard adults say, “High school was the best four years of my life!", yes it is but for me i included my Senior High School 
                days because of that, I expected to have a blast when I entered freshman year. However, I didn't realize high school and senior high school was 
                the best years of their lives because they made it the best years of their lives. I didn't realize that if I also wanted to have the best four years of my life, 
                I needed to do things I actually enjoyed doing.</p>
